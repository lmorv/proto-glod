### 01 - The many ways of getting a player character into the game and why it matters to me

I'm looking at two main workflows for integrating custom characters into the game; each is borne out of the context of the assets that make up the character I'm working with. And working out the kinks of each will hopefully give me a larger tool kit to affect the tone and feel of the game.

The first approach involved migrating the constituent parts of the existing Stack Bot character from the StackOBot project that can be found in the Unreal Marketplace. I'm jumping off from the base knowledge found in this tutorial series: https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/kry/unreal-engine-build-a-third-person-character-from-scratch

The second approach involved replacing the mesh of the mannequin (Quinn) character, that comes with the third person template, with my own character model --rigged using the same skeleton hierarchy as the mannequin. As illustrated in this demo of the Game Rig Tools addon for Blender: https://youtu.be/U23WyAd8o_8

Writing this I feel like I am trying to justify my haphazard explorations with some vague idea of a larger creative master plan. If I am being honest with myself I am just curious to see what happens with either approach. I wanna master them just for the sake of learning them, and seeing where they break and seeing if I can fix them.

Sure, it would be great if I could ultimately combine the animation assets of the Stack Bot, and it's enhanced input system (whatever that might mean for my iterative control and expandability of features) with the base blueprints that are already in place for Many and Quinn (the Unreal mannequins). I like the more stylized look of the Stack Bot's movements over the realistic animations of Quinn, I think. Although I can also see a place for realism later on, I think I want to establish a more unique aesthetic as a first goal.

I want it to be easy for me to iterate on the character model's mesh and rig on whatever in-flux set-up I end up with. But that might not happen exactly as I want it to, and my wishes might prove unrealistic, and the complexity might just be there no matter what I do. I think though, that my best chance at success is to get really familiar with the ins and outs of as many intersecting workflow processes and systems as I can.

And hopefully I can also make progress horizontally, on the overall vision, developing the other domains of the game in parallel to build up a cohesive whole. More on that later I guess.
