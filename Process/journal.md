## Proto Glod - Development Journal

### Jan 26, 2023 - I'm Excited!

I'm excited about this project on multiple levels. From a narrative perspective I am very excited about exploring the story. The mythological themes, the modern-day setting, the surreal directions it could go, fleshing out the main character's journey, developing the silly/existential tone, and finding entreating ways to deliver the narrative. Which ties in with the technical side, for which I am also very excited. After messing around in Unreal for a while, I am eager to dig deeper into it's inner workings, and to having a solid excuse to intentionally design and build game interactions with it. 

This concept started out pretty off-handedly; I wrote the logline months ago as part of an exercise on writing Research Creation project proposals with a randomly assigned theme. My theme was AI Art generation. I conceived of a project where I made use of as many AI art tools as possible in a 'real' production to determine their strengths and limitations while investigating the ethical implications of such tools, through interviews and case studies. The final product would be a sort of documentary, or video essay report relating my journey and findings, rather than a finished game. But very soon after, I found myself thinking that this story deserved better than that. And that if I made it, I wouldn't want it's development to be limited to, and strictly funneled through the existing AI tools. Which is sort of the conclusion that I expected to reach, or the 'hypothesis' of the original proposal. So there's surely something to learn from the AI tools of the future.

I have so many ideas, and I am also slightly afraid of how exponentially complicated I could make it on myself. The more I sit with this concept the the more I fall in love with it, and the more possibilities I uncover.  I want to get a good handle on the core mechanics, and a good feel for the foundational elements of the narrative systems. But extrapolating and endlessly conceptualizing is gonna be hard to resist.

### Jan 28, 2023 - A breakthrough and too many ideas.

I've been low-key struggling to picture the way dialogue from Tezcatlipoca is delivered. I thought that maybe it could come from people whose heads you have replaced with objects at first, or as a disembodied voice, sometimes coming from objects or inside your oen head. But it's always been nebulous in my mind. 

Well I just had a breakthrough! I thought that it would be a good idea to have Tezcatlipoca's dialogue delivered mainly through the book. As a sort of archive of information about your powers, events, responses to your actions, tutorials, etc. 

For example; the first time you change someone's head into a chair, the book could show an '!' icon and then deliver Tezcatlipoca's observations in a floating UI box:

>"Oh that's interesting! The 'chair' was attached upside-down to that human's neck. Perhaps the object remembers that the 'backrest' should go against the wearer's back. I wonder if you'll eventually be able to control the orientation of things you swap out..." 

Maybe there can be options in the dialogue box. Like the possibility to ask "Who are you?" to the book.

>"I don't go around telling people what I call myself as a rule. Although I always break my rules... But this time I might not! Wait. That would also break the rules... I'll get back to you on that one."

The idea is to have leave the mythological associations sort-of vague, and unimportant even when they are revealed. Like nobody knows who Tezcatlipoca is, and nobody cares. Yet they quietly tune the dials of reality in favour of disarray, and their influence ensures that no matter the current conditions; the outcome is never 100% set in stone.

---
On a separate train of thought, I was thinking of fail states and enemy mechanics. The police will chase you around and try to catch you, while you try to turn their heads into inanimate objects.

I was thinking that it would be cool and highly ambitious if when they did catch you, maybe you have a chance to wiggle away, but if you fail you go into Time Out! 

In Time Out you are put in increasing levels of solitary confinement. Every time you escape, the police realize your true power and increase their containment measures (up to a limit where you actually cannot escape, thinking at least a little bit realistically). As a last resort you can choose to restart from a checkpoint with people's knowledge of your potential erased.

### Feb 16, 2023 - Conversations with friends

At a bar about a week ago my friend David pointed out the parallel of the library setting with the Archives from the University, in the fantasy book series The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. The conversation made me very exited about unlock flows and environmental puzzles in the style of TLOZ. And it made me see the larger idea of  places of mystery and cosmic power in a new light. I have as a reference the Federal Bureau of Control from Control that is a very borgesian space (obviously Borge's infinite library comes to mind as well) that acts as a portal between cosmic realms. The Archives, as well as the FBC, and the Water Temple hold arcane mysteries and knowledge. Sources of power and peril for the player/protagonist.

On the sillier side my friend Cesar suggested that I explore the "having to be silent in a library" mechanic in some way. Like trying to get people kicked out by the security guard and the staff, by using your powers to get a loud reaction out of them. What would you do if your coffee tumbler turned into a shoe? maybe different people have a higher threshold for paranormal occurrences and some wouldn't be impressed. Maybe they are reading a book called "Exposure therapy for arachnophobia"-- turn their pencil case into a spider for a big reaction.

Thinking about NPCs and the type of people that one might encounter at libraries opens a whole world of narrative possibilities. I'm already thinking of a couple of human and non-human characters and archetypes that I might want to incorporate into the mix. The videogame series Yakuza that I've been co-playing with another friend (Zach) is a good reference for a story heavily driven by dialogue and complex character interactions. I have to remember to add a prototype NPC with some dialogue, maybe path finding, early on to discover how that's going to feel, and how I want it to go.

### Feb 18, 2023 - 3rd person character tech adventures 

This is a Discord chat conversation with my friend David about the various trials I encountered yesterday while integrating an existing Bot character, and all it's related assets from another UE project to replace the default 3rd person character in the project.

This was in part an exercise to get familiar with the workflow for doing this sort of thing, and also a way to approximate the game feel i'm looking for while I work on the level design. The Bot character has more of a 'child like' feel to it in both proportions and the way it's animated. So I think it will be useful to design the space with it as a reference as long as I don't have the final design and assets for the main character.

So here's what went down:

[...]
I'm doing some 3rd person character stuff on my chaos demi-god game.
trynna replace the character with a little robot guy just as a test, I finally got all the assets to import correctly, and I fixed up some issues with the character blueprint class that where making it not compile.
**LeoMorV** â€” Today at 12:36 PM
Now I'm editing the 'default pawn class' in the main game mode to make it use the little bot's BP [blueprint]. And I am wondering if there's a way to choose what character BP to use based on a UI choice or something like that...
Also; I tried changing the default game mode, in the project settings, to a game mode that uses the bot character and it didn't work. So that's why I'm modifying the main game mode instead.

>**Leggs** â€” Today at 12:41 PM
the gamemode is set per level, so your level settings might've been overriding the project settings mode
for picking a character bp, you could set the default pawn to null and manually spawn and possess your own pawn  in response to e.g. a UI event 
**Leggs** â€” Today at 12:53 PM
did you ever watch The Green Knight?

>**LeoMorV** â€” Today at 1:00 PM
Yeah! It was great, and strange

>**Leggs** â€” Today at 1:00 PM
cool, I just remembered it exists and I meant to watch it, gotta get on that

>**LeoMorV**â€” Today at 1:24 PM
Defo recommend ðŸ‘Œ [Just like this tech adventures the movie is very unsatisfying in an interesting way, but I didn't wanna spoil that feeling for David. I'll ask for his thoughts after he's seen it.]
**LeoMorV** â€” Today at 1:58 PM
Okaay, so now I don't knw why my character is not taking any input ðŸ˜©

>**Leggs** â€” Today at 2:27 PM
did you Possess it?
or you can check AutoPossess On Spawn or something like that

>**LeoMorV** â€” Today at 2:42 PM
Hmmm , I have "Auto Posses Player"  under the 'Pawn' options of the character blueprint. And I set it from 'Disabled' to 'Player 0'.

>**LeoMorV** â€” Today at 3:26 PM
I figured out that I needed to set the default input classes to the 'enhanced' ones cuz I am using the Enhanced Input plugin to set up the actions on the bot. Thankfully this doesn't affect the default third person game mode if I choose to switch back to it. But now the inputs are acting extremely whack...

>**Leggs** â€” Today at 4:45 PM
depends what "whack" means specifically, I've used enhanced input a bit so maybe I can help

>**LeoMorV** â€” Today at 8:07 PM
There's a lot of stuff going on at once contributing to the whack factor. I can show you next time we hang.

The funny thing is that, in the future, when I get to integrate the final character model, I'll probably use a slightly different method that will probably be simpler. It'll involve duplicating the main game mode and the default character blueprint and just replacing the mesh with a model rigged using the exact same bone structure as Quinn (the default character). I'll have to do some re-targeting, or some hacky workaround, to adapt the animations to the smaller proportions. 

But there's a reason why I think it's worth it to go through the trouble of integration the stack bot, and its animations and, its animation blueprint, using the enhanced input system and all. But anyway; this entry is getting very long and and convoluted --I'll leave that discussion for my first entry on 'why'.

And I'll have to remember to describe what the 'whack' is all about at the moment, just for the fun of it. Maybe as a sort of bug report to myself.
