This is the repo for Proto-Glod. A game about discovering hidden powers and messing with reality.

## Artist Statement:

Proto-Glod is a third-person narrative action playground game. The player steps into the shoes of a 5 to 7 year old child in a library, who can change any one object into any any other by storing an imprint of the object in a magical book, then targeting another object in the environment. It's all fun and games until you use your powers on a human. 

Divine forces of Order and Chaos, as well as the human police, are alerted to your existence. And step forth to oppose and aid you in your quest of self discovery and rampant reality-exploitative fun.

**Narrative concept logline:** 
    A young kid discovers that they can change the physical world by merely thinking about it, transforming matter and energy. They can act in small playful ways at first, but laws of conservation catch up to them as their power progressively increases; putting the very fabric and structure of existence at risk. Reality-based hijinks ensue, and mystic-cosmic shenanigans emerge out of the chaos. The kid learns that they are a demigod of indeterminacy; offspring of Primordial Chaos, god of non-deterministic fate; Tezcatlipoca.
