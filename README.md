# proto-glod: Awakening Incommensurate

This is the repo for Proto-Glod. A game about discovering hidden powers and messing with reality. The principal goal of this production is to use the intentional direction of a creative concept to learn about the Unreal development framework in more practical detail, and document the process under the Games As Research MDA methodology.

## Artist Statement & Narrative concept:

Proto-Glod is a third-person narrative-fabulative action playground game. The player steps into the shoes of a 5 to 7 year old child in a library, who can change any one object into any other by storing an imprint of the object in a magical book, then targeting another object in the environment. It's all fun and games until you use your powers on a human. Reality-based hijinks ensue, and mystic-cosmic shenanigans emerge out of the chaos. The kid learns that they are a demigod of indeterminacy; conduit of primordial chaos, god(dess) of non-deterministic fate from Mesoamerican mythology: Tezcatlipoca.

Divine forces of Order and Chaos, as well as the human police, are alerted to your existence. And step forth to oppose and aid you in your quest of self discovery and rampant reality-exploitative fun. As it turns out, changing the physical world by merely thinking about it --transforming matter and energy-- comes up against detrimental phenomena mediated by laws of conservation. And it really grits the metaphorical teeth of certain entities; auditors of reality, as they are known in Terry Pratchet’s Discworld --embodied forces of order and pragmatism. 

Our demi-god anti hero can act in small playful ways at first. But, as their power progressively increases; the very fabric and structure of existence is put at risk. Which is maybe not entirely a bad thing. Tezcatlipoca encourages ever-increasing abstraction, human imagination is the limit. 

The tone of the game is meant to be comical. Absurd, silly, and whimsical even when dealing with existential themes and potentially disturbing elements of magical violence. It is not meant to be graphic nor explicit, but it does intend to take horror and dread seriously from a storytelling and action-based performance perspective. All the elements of the design, from visual aesthetics, to writing, to interaction mechanics, should be in service of a welcoming and playful atmosphere that invites players to view the conditions of our mortal existence as a source of amusement and dynamic transformation, rather than fear and nihilism.
