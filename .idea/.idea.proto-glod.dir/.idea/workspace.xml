    <task id="LOCAL-00004" summary="Gameplay: Success! Via the power of friendship&#10;&#10;- I have been really struggling with the implementation of the core object swapping mechanic. Getting around the communication tangle through interfaces and actors (objects), and blueprint components, and unknown gaps in my knowledge. I just could not get it to work. Not only did I not know a bunch of thing; I didnt know that I did not know a whole other bunch of things.&#10;&#10;- This weekend I finally consulted my friend David. He basically unblocked me and intervened in my blueprints in key ways that I would have not figured out om my own. I was tangled up in a number of stacked effects that worked against me. 1) the 'cyclic' implementation of the object swapping interaction was absorbing the mouse click event input --not allowing it to be used by my new blueprint code. We turned off 'absorb input' on the test actor in the level, then got rid of it entirely after it caused more shenanigans (might re-introduce later just for fun). 2) trying to store component data from my selectable objects using the events and variables in the 'selectable object interface' proved to be an unnecessary complication (I'm still using the interface to change the visibility of the highlight decal, via it's events, and to display the interaction indicator UI). Instead we used variables on the character blueprint to store ('get') and 'set' the static mesh components. 3) We had to create 2 'levels' of variables ('mesh' and 'mesh mesh') for the objects in the interaction (targeted, and target objects); one of the variables refers to the static mesh 'component' in the actor blueprint, and the other to the actual static mesh 'asset' in use within that component. 4) Finally and most fundamentally, I had been thinking of the interaction as happening all within the same input (Left Mouse Button); where clicking on an object would store its mesh in a variable, then clicking on another object would swap that object's mesh with the one stored in the variable. Instead we opted to have a separate input (Right Mouse Button) be in charge of the swap, which made it much more simple to conceive of the getting and setting of the static mesh components/ assets in practice, and it makes for a more interesting and clear gameplay experience (at least to me and David at this moment).&#10;&#10;- So the current behaviour goes like this: 1) pressing either left or right mouse button will select the targeted object, highlighting it with an emissive decal and storing its static mesh (using 2 'levels' of variables). 2) Pressing the same input again on the same object will have no effect. 2) Pressing the same input on a different object will 'select' that new object and 'deselect' the old one. 3) The Player must press the opposite mouse button while targeting the second object in order to swap its mesh with the selected object's mesh (if selection was made with the Left Mouse button, the swap must be made with the Right Mouse Button, and vise-versa).&#10;&#10;- Next up for this feature is extending its functionality to work with Left and Right trigger buttons on a gamepad. And to color-code the selected object's highlight decal depending on weather it was selected with the Left or Right input. Hopefully that will help communicate the mechanic better, and help players remember what button should be pressed next to enact the swap during play.&#10;&#10;- I have documented this implementation with screenshots in my knowledge base for future reference.">
