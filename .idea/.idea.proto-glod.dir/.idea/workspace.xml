It which turned out to be more complicated that I expected, even tho I had already done it in the past for the Stack Bot bug build. I might have deleted my implementation on the stack bot game mode cause I thought it was 'hacky' solution. I also think the current one is sorta hacky, but I am proud of how I figured it out from the limited info online, and this time I documented the process on my knowledge base. It is definetly not the same solution I used before, I had to learn about the 'user settings' nodes, and I dont know what about my current set up made the previous method unusable (or if it's just the fact that I dont quite remember what it was exactly). &#10; &#10; - I also made a turnabout technical drawing sheet and started modeling Obsidian! I had a lot of fun coloring the 3/4 view and I even drew some props; the gemboid, a backpack, and a jaguar mask I that I really like. I have now started to block-out the character in 3D, using the Void Being model as a base mesh. I'm sculpting on Nomad Sculpt on the Ipad.">
