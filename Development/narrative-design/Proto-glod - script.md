Interior. Library. Undetermined time of day.

This fifth sun might yet come to an end.

At the edge of infinity, the [thermodynamic] gradient may yet bring perfect balance to this era.

And quench the flame of change.

And the sixth sun to come will be unlit. 

Suuuun 12345. 6 fin. In.fin.it, night graaadiEnt un.lit, light. Ob.si.di.an:

Was there always a voice? I mean in my head. I think it used to be only pictures and videos. **This is strange...** And dreams. I don't think the voice was there. ** How did I get here?** There might have been voices in the videos, and there were sounds... **Now...** But it's hard to tell if there was a voice. **I like where this is going.**

...

How does the writing in the books get in my head? How does it play in my brain? **You do that. It's called 'thinking', and 'understanding'** I know that! But how did it get there? And why?

**The 'how' is simple; by chance. Although not for you, by the time you came around it was inevitable. The 'why' doesn't really matter in my opinion, as long as you're having fun. Are you having fun?** Yes. **Okay, remember to take frequent breaks.** I know it's my voice, but I can also make other voices. **That's a lot of power you're wielding. You can read words and know their meaning, you can think of words of your own in meaningful configurations. What else can you do?**. I can run really fast! **Show me**

**I'm not gonna lie, that was pretty slow. But that's okay.** I wasn't really going full speed. **Why would you hold back?** I have to be quiet. Otherwise, the librarian will take me away from the computer. Or worse. She'll call my mum at work. **Very well, I believe you. You'll run if you have to. And you will not hold back.** When I run for real, no one can catch me. Unless they are very fast, like me. 

**Alright, let's try something else then; can you shape-shift? Or shape-shift something else? Try changing that slate into this book you're holding here.** What is a slate? **The black mirror in front of you. It's not quite a smoking mirror, and it feels flimsy from where I'm at, but it will do.**  Smoking is bad. **Smoke is the aftermath of fire, and fire is mostly rapid change.* *

There I did it, the screen is a book now. Are you a book? **I guess I am. To you right now right now anyway. haha! I'm a book!** What is your name? **Your people knew me as Tezcatlipoca, if I remember correctly. That might have changed, though. As things do.** My name is Obsidian. **Obsidian, are YOU a book?** I don't think so... **No, I don't think you think so also. You think you're far from a book, you think you are far from being anything other than yourself. You'll grow out of thinking that way, however**.  When I grow up, I'll still be myself! If I grow up. I don't think I'll do it. **Indeed. That might be so. Although growing in size would probably be fairly easy for you.** 

*Com.bus.tion
noun
1. *The process of burning.
2. *A chemical change, especially oxidation, accompanied by the production of heat and light.

I know what fire is! **But do you understand it?** I like turtles.

**You are going to need to know more objects other than books. Let's see. What objects do you have? Examine the contents of your carrier bag.** I have a water bottle, another book, pencil, notebook, a solar gemboid. **A photonic gem in book form. Some things don't change for long periods of time, other things change back to thighs they were before. Your kind are SUN worshipers, I am fond of the foolish child myself.** I also have a juice box and some animal crackers. **Rations with the shape of creatures, and boxed nectar. As befits your mortal nature. I don't think you'd die in the conventional sense anyhow. But let's not test that if we don't have to. Promise you wont try to die.** I promise I will not try not to not die. **Good.**

**Who is the librarian?** The librarian is a friend of mum. She's ok I guess.

**Who is mum?** Mum is my mom.

**Who is turtles?** Turtles is many of them. I love them. **Turtles sounds terrifying.**

Who are you again? **I am Tezcatlipoca.**

I want to turn more things into books. **Turn as many things into books as possible.** But also into other things **I am curious as to weather you can do that myself.**  But I have to be quiet, so the librarian doesn't notice. Her office is just downstairs, and she will come check on me for sure.

Looks like I can only turn books into other books, and computers into books and books into computers. And computers and books into gemboids. **All those things are all clearly similar to each other.** Same energy. **Information storage properties.** I don't know what that means.

### obsidian... I've been looking for you...

Oh no, It's the librarian. **Run. I sense confinement in her intent.**

### Breadcrumbs home are all devoured. A total annihilation of the place-time matrix, in this space something has happened; some juncture some flux. 

### It doesn't happen often, so we must take out time. Our time is now to do it right. Be concise, be collected be prepared. Be the balancing flames kept at a steady temperature; that bring total obliteration.

A peaceful slumber is not smooth colorless void. What are you talking about? That is not the librarian.

### The dark librarian is no more. And your reign of terror ends with me.

Big mistake! She shouldn't have said that in that way. Self-identifycation never goes well with the auditors. The anchored body must be working overtime to maintain their materiality. I want a really big dog so I can ride them into the forest. But at first it would be a puppy and they would be too small to ride, and I could take them to school in my backpack. And then he could take me to school instead of mum. But we wont go to school; we'll go to the forest behind school , past the tall fence that I can climb over but no one knows. We'll collect rocks by the little river and try to catch frogs.

**The cellular network of your hands and feet**. Oh! I don't know anything about that. **The ground that stretches out beneath you**

### A fragile and mortal coherence. We have come to a nexus, I believe.

Quick! Come this way.

It's the real librarian! **Weirdly there's also confinement in HER intent.**

I am so glad you are okay! Hold me tight in warm embrace. Something is going toopsy with this place. I cant find my office where I left my stuff. I've been trying to find security and you, but let's go to the breakroom for now and we can have a snack.

### Poised for action; perfect plural perception. Metope parallel to extrusion. Indent among triglyphs. A load bearing colonnade particularly sound, sounds like an excuse. 

Spatial knowledge abounds, use it wisely. Normally I would advice otherwise. Normally I would not advice, if anything I would un-advice. I guess there is a first time for everything. You are an anomaly after all.

somewhere the network links break decisively under the scrutiny of watchful towers. This sprawl you see beneath resembles no mind, no prior knowledge hereby given in thine short life.

What if the opposite is true? if quads and tri-polys notice your existence. Them the observer instead of you. Another frame of reference in motion. Which explosion happens first? What nonsense simultaneity. And everyone is correct. In thinking, in acting. In the transparent nature of bread. What serious pineapple, pinnapple, pinacle, signals its end. Salutations from the mortal realm. I wonder when is lunchtime. And when, if ever, lunchtime ends. It is sad to think that, in reality, most of time is non-lunch time.

One can imagine an alternate universe where all of time is lunch-time. What a universe that would be!

Okay now something that moves the plot along. If I remember correctly there was about to appear a cylinder. A HUGE chrome cylinder. And we... And. What happened with my... And we were searching for the breakroom. Pen just now? Do I just have to give up on writing comprehensively?
