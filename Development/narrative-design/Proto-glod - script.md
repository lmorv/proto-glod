Int. Library. Day

This fifth sun might yet come to an end.
At the edge of infinity, the thermodynamic gradient may yet bring perfect balance to this era.
And quench the flame of change.
And the sixth constellation to come will be unlit. 

Obsidian:
Was there always a voice inside my head? I think it used to be only pictures and videos. And dreams. I don't think the voice was there. There might have been voices in the videos, and there were sounds... But it's hard to tell if there was a voice back then.

How does the writing in the books get in my head? How does it play in my brain? **You do that. It's called 'thinking', and 'understanding'** I know that! But how did it get there? And why?

**The 'how' is simple; by chance. Although not for you, by the time you came around it was inevitable. The 'why' doesn't really matter in my opinion, as long as you're having fun. Are you having fun?** Yes. **Okay, remember to take frequent breaks.** I know it's my voice, but I can also make other voices. **That's a lot of power you're wielding. You can read words and know their meaning, you can think of words of your own in meaningful configurations. What else can you do?**. I can run really fast! *Show me*

*I'm not gonna lie, that was pretty slow. But that's okay.* I wasn't really going full speed. *Why would you hold back?* I have to be quiet. Otherwise, the librarian will take me away from the computer. Or worse. She'll call my mom at work. *Very well, I believe you. You'll run if you have to. And you will not hold back.* When I run for real, no one can catch me. Unless they are very fast, like me. 

*Alright, let's try something else then; can you shape-shift? Or shape-shift something else? Try changing that slate into this book you're holding here.* What is a slate? *The black mirror in front of you. It's not quite a smoking mirror, and it feels flimsy from where I am, but it will do.*  Smoking is bad. *Smoke is the aftermath of fire, and fire is mostly rapid change.* 

There I did it, the screen is a book now. Are you a book? **I guess I am. To you right now. I'm a book!** What is your name? **Your people knew me as Tezcatlipoca, if I remember correctly. That might have changed, though, as things do.** My name is Obsidian. *Obsidian, are YOU a book?* I don't think so... *No, I don't think you think so also. You think you're far from a book, you think you are far from being anything other than yourself. You'll grow out of thinking that way, however*.  When I grow up, I'll still be myself!, If I grow up. I don't think I'll do it. **Indeed. That might be so.**

*Com.bus.tion
noun
1. *The process of burning.
2. *A chemical change, especially oxidation, accompanied by the production of heat and light.

I know what fire is! **But do you understand it?** I like turtles. **I like turtles too.**

**You are going to need to know more objects other than books. Let's see. What do you have? Examine the contents of your carrier bag.** I have a water bottle, another book, pencil, notebook, a solar-powered Game Boy. **Makes sense. Some things don't change for a long time, other things change back to thighs they were before. Your kind are sun worshipers, I am fond of the foolish child myself.** I also have a juice box and some animal crackers. **Rations with the shape of creatures, and boxed nectar. As befits your mortal nature. I don't think you'd die in the conventional sense anyhow**
